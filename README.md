Mood-Matic is a virtual reality scene that allows you to host a virtual party. For this assignment, I used 3 different interactable controls - A button, a lever and a socket. Each control has a corresponding clue to what it does next to it.

The button on the left allows the player to cycle through 19 different skyboxes, which can set the mood according to the music desired.

The buttons with start/stop allow the player to cycle through 5 different types of music on the playlist. Pressing start will cycle through the songs and stop will stop the music altogether.

The levers control two different types of special effects, one based on a fire show and other a more "disco" type lighting.

Finally, the diamond on the right, when placed in its socket, will populate the area with dancing figures for a vibrant party environment.
